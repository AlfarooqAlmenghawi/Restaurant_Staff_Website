# **Late Plate (Restaurant Availability App)**

### Description

This project consists of the staff side version of the application. The idea of the full project was that it would be for people who want to eat out but may have missed the chance to book a table in advance, so it uses the user’s location to give them instant access to all of the restaurants that are available near them and make a booking for a table on the same day once they see the restaurant they’d like to eat at. In this repository, we created a Restaurant Staff side web application where the staff can create and manage their restaurants, tables and bookings made by customers.

### Technologies used

We used React and react native as they are widely used for websites and mobile apps respectively and we wanted to deepen our experience with react. Supabase allowed for real-time updates, native user authorization and making queries from the front end, allowing us to focus on building our extensive front end without worrying about making an API.

### Challenges Faced

Challenges faced include managing the various interactions with the database such as checking table availability at different times and real-time updates were a challenge to implement and more difficult than we first anticipated.
